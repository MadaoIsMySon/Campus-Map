Problem1: 
	q1.a: 
	    X m(X y, String s);
	    Y m(Object y, Object s);
	q1.b: 
		X m(X y, String s) : override
		Y m(Object y, Object s) : overload
		Z m(Y y, String s): overload
		

	q2.a:
		No, IsoscelesTriangle changed the effects of setSides and will
		    surprise the client by change both this.b and this.c to b. 
		    It does not have a stronger specification.
	q2.b:
		Squid is not a true subtype because it returns 0 while Vertebrate
		returns an integer>0. So Squid does not have a stronger specification.
		
		Human is a true subtype because it returns 7 which is stronger than 
		the return of Vertebrate. So the specification of human is stronger
		than that of Vertebrate.     
    q2.c:
    	MountainBike is a true subtype of Bicycle because it inherit all methods
    	except for the constructor in Bicycle and Bicycle can be substituted with
    	MountainBike.
    q2.d:
    	ConcurrentAccount is not a true subtype of Account because it throws an
    	additional exception.
